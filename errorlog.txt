    },
    {
      "question": "Explain the mechanism of pulsus paradoxus.",
      "answer": "Normally, pulse volume decreases during inspiration and increases during expiration due to intrathoracic (intrapleural) pressure changes affecting venous return. Inspiration -> ↓ (more negative) intrathoracic pressure -> ↑venous return -> ↑right ventricular stroke volume -> ↑left ventricular stroke volume (ventricular interdependence). Pericardial effusion causes cardiac tamponade, during inspiration, ↑ left ventricular filling -> ↓↓stroke volume -> ↓↓SBP. A/c severe asthma -> ↓↓ (more more negative) intrathoracic(intrapleural)pressure -> ↑afterload -> ↓left ventricular stroke volume."

    },
    {
      "question": "What does the volume of the pulse depend on?",
      "answer": "This gives a rough guide to the pulse pressure, which depends on stroke volume and the compliance of the arteries."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the volume of the arterial pulse assessed?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the result of a positive rebound tenderness test?",
      "answer": "As a result of this abrupt removal, the abdominal musculature springs back into its original place. The patient will immediately cry out or at least wince in pain."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the mechanism of pain in rebound tenderness?",
      "answer": "This is because the parietal peritoneum which has already been inflamed due to the presence of an underlying inflamed organ also springs back along with the abdominal muscles."

    {
      "question": "How can an enlarged spleen be identified on palpation?",
      "answer": "When enlarged it extends from the left costal margin to the right iliac fossa.\n\nIt moves freely with respiration.\n\nSplenic swelling has a sharp anterior border, where one or two notches can be felt."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the spleen palpated?",
      "answer": "For palpation - The right hand of the examiner is placed parallel to the left costal margin at the level of the umbilicus and the subject is asked to breathe in and out.\n\nThe left hand is kept behind the left lower ribs and slides the skin downwards so that the right hand gets an extra bit of skin to insinuate beneath the left costal margin.\n\nDuring expirations, gradually slide the hand towards the left costal margin till the splenic swelling touches the ulnar border of the index finger during inspiration.\n\nAn enlarged spleen appears just below the tip of the 10th rib."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "question": "Is the normal kidney usually palpable?",
      "answer": "The kidney is not usually palpable except for the lower pole, which is felt as a smooth, rounded firm swelling between both the right and left hands."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can a kidney be differentiated from other structures on palpation?",
      "answer": "It can be pushed from one hand to the other and it descends on deep inspiration."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does generalized distension of the abdomen indicate in acute intestinal obstruction?",

      "answer": "Defining the boundaries of abdominal organs"
    },
    {
      "question": "How are the boundaries of the liver defined by percussion?",
      "answer": "The upper and the lower borders of the right lobe of the liver can be defined accurately by percussion.\n\nStart anteriorly in the fourth intercostal space, where the note will be resonant over the lungs, and work vertically downwards.\n\nIn the normal liver the upper border is at the 5th intercostal space, where the note will become dull.\n\nThis dullness extends down to the lower border formed by the right subcostal margin."
    },
    {
      "question": "What can reduce the normal dullness over the liver?",
      "answer": "The normal dullness over the upper part of the liver is reduced in severe emphysema, large pneumothorax, and the presence of gas or air in the peritoneal cavity left lower ribs into the left hypochondrium and liver."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where does the spleen's dullness extend from?",
      "answer": "Its dullness extends from the left lumbar region."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does \"shifting dullness\" test for?",
      "answer": "The presence of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the test for shifting dullness performed?",
      "answer": "It can be determined by eliciting shifting dullness.\n\nWhen the subject lies on his back the fluid gravitates down to the flanks and the intestine floats on the center of the abdomen which will therefore be resonant and the flanks dull.\n\nPercussion should be commenced from the center of the abdomen and is carried down to one flank.\n\nAt the point where dullness starts, the finger is kept in its position and the subject is asked to turn to the opposite side.\n\nThat particular area is again percussed after waiting for a few minutes to allow the fluid to gravitate down. Now the note will be resonant to make the shifting dullness test positive."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does a \"fluid thrill\" test for?",
      "answer": "It tests for ascites (free fluid in the abdomen)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the test for a fluid thrill performed?",
      "answer": "When the patient is lying in the supine position, one hand of the examiner is placed over the lumbar region on one side.\n\nThe opposite side of the abdomen is flicked or tapped with the fingers of the opposite hand.\n\nA distinct vibration is felt on the palpating hand if ascites is present."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can you avoid false positives when testing for a fluid thrill?",
      "answer": "During the test, an assistant is asked to place the ulnar border of his hand firmly in the midline of the abdomen to avoid impulse transmission through fat."

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the \"silent abdomen\" and what does it signify?",
      "answer": "The 'silent abdomen' is a pathognomonic feature of diffuse peritonitis. Even localized absence of peristaltic sound will be evident around acute inflammation of the organ concerned."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the \"noisy abdomen\" and what does it signify?",
      "answer": "On the contrary, a 'noisy abdomen' is a feature of acute intestinal obstruction. Normal intestinal sound is heard as clicks and gurgles but in intestinal obstruction distinct metallic tinkles or 'borborygmi' is heard."
